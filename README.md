## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Basic knowledge of competitive programming concepts

### Compilation
```bash
# Compile a C++ solution
g++ -o solution solution.cpp

# Run the executable
./solution

# For Windows
solution.exe
```

### File Naming Convention
- Problem solutions are typically named with letters (a.cpp, b.cpp, c.cpp) or descriptive names
- Executable files are stored in `output/` directories
- Each contest or topic has its own organized directory structure

## 📖 Learning Path

1. **Start with Simple Problems** - Begin with the basic competitive problems in `C++ competitive/Sencillos/`
2. **Learn Core Algorithms** - Study the topic-based solutions for backtracking, binary search, etc.
3. **Practice with Contests** - Work through the training camp contests and Codeforces problems
4. **Advanced Topics** - Explore the algorithm classes and complex problem solutions

## 🎯 Problem Categories

- **Easy**: Basic implementation problems, simple algorithms
- **Medium**: Greedy algorithms, binary search, basic data structures
- **Hard**: Dynamic programming, advanced algorithms, complex optimizations

## 🔧 Contributing
